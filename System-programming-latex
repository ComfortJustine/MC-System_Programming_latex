\subsection{Q1}Explain what happened in the above code,state the time complexity of the above situation(Use proper terms is important)?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item\underline{1.The main function is called an initial value of 4\\} 
    \item\underline{2.The print function is called with this value(4) as an argument\\}
    \item\underline{3.inside print function prints the value of nb.(which is 4),increaments by 1  to become 5, checks if it's less than 10.\\}
    \item\underline{4.since 5 is less than 10, the print function is called RECURSIVELY with the updated value of nb which is 5.\par}
    \item\underline{5.This process continues and keeps printing and increamenting the value until nb becomes 10.\\}
    \item\underline{6.When nb reaches 10,the condition in the if statement is no longer true, and the recursion stops.\\}
    \item\underline{So the code will print the numbers from 4 to 9 giving the time complexity to be 0(n),where n is the the difference between the initial value(4) and the limit(10).In case,n is 6,so the function will be called 6 times in total.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Q2.a}How many bytes will each of the below statements allocate?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1.malloc(sizeof(int) * 10).Answer:\underline{40 bytes}
    \item 2.malloc(sizeof(unsigned int) * 2).Answer:\underline{8 bytes}
    \item 3.malloc((sizeof(char) * 10) + 1).Answer:\underline{11 bytes}
    \item 4.malloc(10).Answer:\underline{10 bytes}
    \item 5.malloc(sizeof(char) * 10).Answer:\underline{10 bytes}
    \item 6.malloc(sizeof(int) * 4).Answer:\underline{16 bytes}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Q2.b}What is Valgrind?\par
Answer:\underline{Valgrind is the program used in memory leak dectection}

\subsection{Q3.a}What will you see on the terminal?\\
Answer:\underline{B}

\subsection{Q3.b}Answer all the questions\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item i.malloc returns a pointer.Answer:\underline{B}
    \item ii.malloc returns an address.Answer:\underline{B}
    \item iii.The momery space reserved when calling malloc is on what?Answer:\underline{A}
    \item iv.You can do this: (char str[] = "Best School" free(str));Answer:\underline{B}
    \item v.You can do this: (free("Best School"));Answer:\underline{A}
    \item vi.You can do this: (char *s; s = strdup("Best School"); if(s != NULL){free(s)}).Answer:\underline{B}
    \item vii.What is wrong with this code:(int cp(void){char *s; s = malloc(12); strcpy(s, "Best School"); return(0);}).Answer:\underline{B}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Q4 Pointers and Addresses}In computer science, a pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address.\\This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some causes,that of memory-mapped compter hardware.According to "Wikipedia."\\
Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn.Some C programming tasks are performed more easly with pointers, and other tasks,such as dynamic memory allocation,cannot be performed without using pointers.\\So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer.\\
Implement a valid method or function that can swap two variables?\\
Answer:\underline{(int a, int b){int temp;temp = a;a = b;b = temp;}}
